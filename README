python-savepage - Created by Bradley Heath (@dogpellet)

A python script to download an HTML page and any links to images, CSS and javascript.

Features:
	- Download images in the HTML page as well as in linked CSS files or embedded CSS.
	- Files are stored locally with unique filenames and all references in any HTML and CSS
	  are modified.

Limitation:
	- Will not download links created by dynamic JavaScript (e.g any JS that calls 
	  document.CreateElement("img") will be missed by python-savepage).

savepage.py <url> <outpath>
A command line version of the tool that downloads the web page at
<url> and saves it to <outpath>.
